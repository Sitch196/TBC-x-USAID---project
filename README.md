# TBCxUSAID react project

## Description


This project is created using `Vite`, a fast and efficient frontend build tool for JavaScript projects and `React`, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The choice of Vite as the build tool enhances the development workflow, providing swift builds and a seamless development experience. Vite's speed and modern features contribute to a performant and optimized web application.

For styling, `plain CSS` is used to ensure simplicity and flexibility. This allows for a customized and visually appealing user interface without the overhead of a complex styling framework.

To enhance the user experience, `Framer Motion` is integrated for subtle sliding animations. Framer Motion adds a touch of elegance to the user interface, creating smooth transitions and engaging interactions that elevate the overall user experience.

`Font Awesome` is utilized for incorporating a diverse set of icons into the project. This ensures a visually appealing and intuitive design, providing users with clear visual cues and enhancing the overall aesthetics of the application.

The combination of Vite, React, plain CSS, Framer Motion, and Font Awesome results in a well-rounded and polished web application, delivering a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.
